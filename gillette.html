            <h3>North America</h3>
            <p>Launching Gillette's new top-of-the-line ProShield razor was a global effort across numerous departments. With the rise of budget shaving competitors like Dollar Shave Club and Harry's, Gillette saw its market share threatened. Our team activated trusted eCommerce partners who could handle the P&G marketing arm, while designing a number of new tools to address issues unique to each market. In North America, these included value, comfort, flexibility, and ease of blade replacement.</p>

            <h3>Asia</h3>
            <p>We discovered the Asian shaving market has a number of purchase obstacles that differentiate it from North America. In general, a smooth, clean shave is preferred to any facial hair in the business sector. Also, the facial hair of Asian men doesn't tend to be as thick or coarse as that of most Americans. These findings lead to development of a new module for "Wet Shaving" where detailing the proper routine is beneficial.</p>

            <h3>Mobile eCommerce</h3>
            <p>Mobile eCommerce is further developed in Asia than it is in the western world. Asian shoppers prefer as much data as possible to lend credibility against knock-offs. Furthermore, bold colors and flashing graphics are accepted as the norm on most product pages. Our team considered all of thes quirks when designing product pages and tools for Tmall.com.</p>
