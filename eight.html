        <h2>Eight Sleep</h2>
        <p>Eight is changing the way we approach sleep with its patented smart mattresses. They tasked me with redesigning their About Us page to better capture the brand's energy and appeal to lifestyle consumers.</p><br>
        <p>After researching their market, I discovered trust was an essential part of the customer's decision-making process. This lead me to a solution that engaged the user in a conversational tone while presenting the company's story.</p>

            <h3>Infused with Energy, Backed by Science</h3>
            <p>The brand has positioned itself as the mattress for ambitious individuals who wake up ready to take on the day's challenges. I wanted to convey a similar energy in my design, which would infuse life into a traditionally mundane product.</p><br>
            <p>Eight has a growing list of scientific advisors who help examine sleep patterns and trends to provide in-depth analysis on sleep quality. Sleep data is incredibly powerful, but also personal. Another reason why gaining the customer's trust is a priority.</p>

              <h3>Load Screen Animation</h3>

              <h3>Recovery Dial</h3>
              <p>Taking the brand's logo and ethos surrounding the power of eight hours of sleep, I created this scroll-based experience to educate the user. The objective is to help the shopper learn more about the product while reinforcing brand values.</p>

            <h3>Project Brief</h3>
            <p>The previous version of the About Us page was lacking a dynamic personality to fit the brand. With such a powerful product, I wanted my design to adequately reflect what the company set out to do: change our perception of sleep and radically improve sleep quality.</p><br>
            <p>From a design standpoint, my briefing was fairly open-ended as long as I included the content in the wireframe above. I expanded upon this content by creating the conversational sections that actively engage the user.</p>
